# Final Project : Aromas

## Objective :
To build an educational game on herbs and spices using Rails.

## MVP :
1. Four cards are generated at random for each game.
2. User is prompted when an herb/spice is correctly guessed.
3. An accordian is appended to the DOM to show all the spices for that game session with their description.
4. Based on the randomly generated spices, a list of recipes are shown using the API Food2Fork.

## Technology :
1. Ruby on Rails
2. Javascript
3. HTML
4. CSS
5. Postgresql
6. Semantic UI
7. Food2Fork Recipe API

## Planning :

### Psuedocode -
1. Database for spices. - Name, Description, Image Url, Hint.
2. When the start button is pressed, randomly generated cards should append themselves on to the DOM. Math.floor(Math.random()) can be used for generating those random cards.
3. Match user input with value of the spice from the database.
4. Prompt user when the answer is right or wrong.
5. Use the same set of spices to make an API call.
